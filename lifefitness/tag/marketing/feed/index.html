				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With that said, we have assembled and written the Ultimate Guide to Transportation Reverse logistics as we have finalized our new technology product for Transportation Reverse Logistics. You can download a copy of the industry leading white paper by filling out the form to the right and below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here at Cerasis, we think it’s important that our clients and customers understand that transportation reverse logistics (or reverse logistics in general for that matter) is much more than just a flashy buzzword. It’s an integral part of helping your company thrive in today’s competitive business world. A key part of that is that you fully understand not only what reverse logistics involves and how it can help you, but what its history is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reverse logistics really does go back further than most people realize. The key reason that it’s only now getting the attention it deserves is through the development of transportation reverse logistics programs that help improve efficiency throughout the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cerasis developed, as an added functionality to our proprietary transportation management system, the Cerasis Rater, a transportation reverse logistics product in order to serve our shipper customers and future shipper customers to seamlessly handle returns, especially core returns, and warranty policies in the automotive aftermarket for Less-Than-Truckload shipping. However, for anyone who is looking to implement automation features, gain visibility into, and start reaping the benefits of an efficient transportation reverse logistics process, the Cerasis Reverse Logistics technology product is the only choice.</p>
