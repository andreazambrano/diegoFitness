				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who can forget the GIFs of the ‘90s, or the more up-to-date focus on flat design?</p>
<p>Recently, we’ve seen a surge in popularity of responsive web design, as more and more sites join the drive to become ‘mobile ready’ which is now even more important in the wake of Google’s Mobile Friendly update.</p>
<p>Let’s examine some of the most popular for this and the coming year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. The Proliferation of UI Patterns</h2>
<div class="sep-wrap element-animate element-animate-false left nz-clearfix" data-effect="none"><div class="nz-separator solid" style="border-bottom-color:#16c3b1;width:100px;border-bottom-width:2px;border-bottom-style:solid;margin-bottom:20px;">&nbsp;</div></div>
One of the side effects of responsive design has meant that a lot of sites look similar. However, responsive design isn’t solely to blame. The rise of WordPress sites and the booming theme market also have a hand in it. And some folks, such as Matthew Monbre, have copped to being guilty of following everyone else’s look with his company’s site.<br />
<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>
<img class="size-full wp-image-6374 aligncenter" src="http://ninzio.com/lifefitness/wp-content/uploads/blog2.jpg" alt="blog2" width="870" height="570" /><br />
<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>
<p>But having a similar look isn’t necessarily a bad thing. That’s because we’ve changed the way we consume the web, which has resulted in a lot of common UI design patterns. Design patterns have matured and as such, there’s little in the way of innovation when it comes to UI patterns.</p>
<p>In other words, a checkout will still be a checkout and should function as such. Same with a login model. There’s no real reason to reinvent the wheel. UI patterns must guide users through a smooth experience.<br />
<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>
<p>Here’s a few patterns you should be familiar with:<br />
<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>

<ul class="nz-i-list none">
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>The hamburger menu:</strong> While some criticize this pattern’s use, there’s no doubt that it’s widespread use makes the function easily recognizable for users.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Account registration:</strong> You’ll find this pattern whenever you try to register for a site. There might be a form to fill out or a button that’ll allow you to use a social account to sign up. Multi-step form wizards are also effective since they “chunk out” the required fields, reducing friction and encouraging users to flow through the process.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Long scroll:</strong> Placing all your important elements above the fold is now a well-known myth. Furthermore, almost everyone is accustomed to long scrolls thanks to mobile devices. The technique works especially well for sites that want to lure users through storytelling, and you can still mimic a multi-page site by breaking the scroll into clear sections.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Card Layouts:</strong> Pioneered by Pinterest, cards are everywhere on the web because they present information in bite-sized chunks perfect for scanning. Each card represents one unified concept. Since they act as “content containers”, their rectangular shape makes them easier to re-arrange for different device breakpoints.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Hero images:</strong> Since vision is the strongest human sense, HD hero images are one of the fastest ways to grab a user’s attention. Thanks to advances in bandwidth and data compression, users won’t suffer from slow load times either. One common layout you’ll find is a hero image above the scroll, followed by either zig-zagging sections or a cards-based arrangement.</div></li>
</ul>

<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>
We’ll describe 7 of the most popular animation techniques:<br />
<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>

<ul class="nz-i-list none">
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Loading animations </strong>These are used to entertain users and delight users during an otherwise tedious experience. Loading animations tend to be popular for flat design, minimalism, portfolios and one-page sites. Keep them simple and avoid adding sound. They should however match your site’s personality and color palette.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Navigation and menus (nonscrolling) </strong>Hidden navigation menus have become increasingly popular, especially as they can be used to save screen space. As you can see in the example below created in the collaborative prototyping tool <a href="http://www.uxpin.com/" target="_blank">UXPin</a>, these use animations to reveal a menu when clicking on a specific button and prevent a jarring transition (like a <a href="http://ninzio.com" target="_blank">navigation drawer</a> hidden behind a hamburger icon).</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Hover animations </strong>Hover effects give a more intuitive feel to a site as users mouse over content. Users unsure about a feature’s function tend to hover over them automatically for instant visual feedback.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Galleries and slideshows </strong>Galleries and slideshows are an effective way to showcase multiple images without overburdening the users. These are great for photography sites, product showcases, and portfolios.</div></li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Additional Advice on Web Design Trends</h2>
<div class="sep-wrap element-animate element-animate-false left nz-clearfix" data-effect="none"><div class="nz-separator solid" style="border-bottom-color:#16c3b1;width:100px;border-bottom-width:2px;border-bottom-style:solid;margin-bottom:20px;">&nbsp;</div></div>
Don’t follow trends just because they’re the “hip” thing to do at the moment. Trends represent popular techniques for good reason, but make sure it’s best for your users. For example, an e-commerce site certainly wouldn’t do well as a single-page infinite scrolling site.</p>
<p>Trends are nothing more than additional tools in your designer toolbox. Always pick the right ones for the job.</p>
<p>For more advice on the 10 most important web design trends, check out the free e-book <a href="http://ninzio.com" target="_blank">Web Design Trends 2015 and 2016.</a> You’ll learn from the best with analysis of 166 examples from companies like Google, Apple, Reebok, BMW, Intercom, Adidas, Dropbox, and many more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at Cerasis, we think it’s important that our clients and customers understand that transportation reverse logistics (or reverse logistics in general for that matter) is much more than just a flashy buzzword. It’s an integral part of helping your company thrive in today’s competitive business world. A key part of that is that you fully understand not only what reverse logistics involves and how it can help you, but what its history is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reverse logistics really does go back further than most people realize. The key reason that it’s only now getting the attention it deserves is through the development of transportation reverse logistics programs that help improve efficiency throughout the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that said, we have assembled and written the Ultimate Guide to Transportation Reverse logistics as we have finalized our new technology product for Transportation Reverse Logistics. <strong>You can download a copy of the industry leading white paper by filling out the form to the right and below</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cerasis developed, as an added functionality to our proprietary transportation management system, the <a href="http://ninzio.com/" target="_blank">Cerasis Rater</a>, a transportation reverse logistics product in order to serve our shipper customers and future shipper customers to seamlessly handle returns, especially core returns, and warranty policies in the automotive aftermarket for Less-Than-Truckload shipping. However, for anyone who is looking to implement automation features, gain visibility into, and start reaping the benefits of an efficient transportation reverse logistics process, the Cerasis Reverse Logistics technology product is the only choice.</p>

<p>Recently, we’ve seen a surge in popularity of responsive web design, as more and more sites join the drive to become ‘mobile ready’ which is now even more important in the wake of Google’s Mobile Friendly update.</p>
<p>Let’s examine some of the most popular for this and the coming year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. The Proliferation of UI Patterns</h2>
<div class="sep-wrap element-animate element-animate-false left nz-clearfix" data-effect="none"><div class="nz-separator solid" style="border-bottom-color:#16c3b1;width:100px;border-bottom-width:2px;border-bottom-style:solid;margin-bottom:20px;">&nbsp;</div></div>
One of the side effects of responsive design has meant that a lot of sites look similar. However, responsive design isn’t solely to blame. The rise of WordPress sites and the booming theme market also have a hand in it. And some folks, such as Matthew Monbre, have copped to being guilty of following everyone else’s look with his company’s site.<br />
<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>
<img class="size-full wp-image-6374 aligncenter" src="http://ninzio.com/lifefitness/wp-content/uploads/blog2.jpg" alt="blog2" width="870" height="570" /><br />
<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>
<p>But having a similar look isn’t necessarily a bad thing. That’s because we’ve changed the way we consume the web, which has resulted in a lot of common UI design patterns. Design patterns have matured and as such, there’s little in the way of innovation when it comes to UI patterns.</p>
<p>In other words, a checkout will still be a checkout and should function as such. Same with a login model. There’s no real reason to reinvent the wheel. UI patterns must guide users through a smooth experience.<br />
<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>
<p>Here’s a few patterns you should be familiar with:<br />
<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>

<ul class="nz-i-list none">
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>The hamburger menu:</strong> While some criticize this pattern’s use, there’s no doubt that it’s widespread use makes the function easily recognizable for users.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Account registration:</strong> You’ll find this pattern whenever you try to register for a site. There might be a form to fill out or a button that’ll allow you to use a social account to sign up. Multi-step form wizards are also effective since they “chunk out” the required fields, reducing friction and encouraging users to flow through the process.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Long scroll:</strong> Placing all your important elements above the fold is now a well-known myth. Furthermore, almost everyone is accustomed to long scrolls thanks to mobile devices. The technique works especially well for sites that want to lure users through storytelling, and you can still mimic a multi-page site by breaking the scroll into clear sections.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Card Layouts:</strong> Pioneered by Pinterest, cards are everywhere on the web because they present information in bite-sized chunks perfect for scanning. Each card represents one unified concept. Since they act as “content containers”, their rectangular shape makes them easier to re-arrange for different device breakpoints.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Hero images:</strong> Since vision is the strongest human sense, HD hero images are one of the fastest ways to grab a user’s attention. Thanks to advances in bandwidth and data compression, users won’t suffer from slow load times either. One common layout you’ll find is a hero image above the scroll, followed by either zig-zagging sections or a cards-based arrangement.</div></li>
</ul>

<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>
We’ll describe 7 of the most popular animation techniques:<br />
<div class='gap nz-clearfix' style='height:25px'>&nbsp;</div>

<ul class="nz-i-list none">
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Loading animations </strong>These are used to entertain users and delight users during an otherwise tedious experience. Loading animations tend to be popular for flat design, minimalism, portfolios and one-page sites. Keep them simple and avoid adding sound. They should however match your site’s personality and color palette.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Navigation and menus (nonscrolling) </strong>Hidden navigation menus have become increasingly popular, especially as they can be used to save screen space. As you can see in the example below created in the collaborative prototyping tool <a href="http://www.uxpin.com/" target="_blank">UXPin</a>, these use animations to reveal a menu when clicking on a specific button and prevent a jarring transition (like a <a href="http://ninzio.com" target="_blank">navigation drawer</a> hidden behind a hamburger icon).</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Hover animations </strong>Hover effects give a more intuitive feel to a site as users mouse over content. Users unsure about a feature’s function tend to hover over them automatically for instant visual feedback.</div></li>
<li><div><span class="icon icon-checkmark" style="color:#16c3b1;"></span></div><div><strong>Galleries and slideshows </strong>Galleries and slideshows are an effective way to showcase multiple images without overburdening the users. These are great for photography sites, product showcases, and portfolios.</div></li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Additional Advice on Web Design Trends</h2>
<div class="sep-wrap element-animate element-animate-false left nz-clearfix" data-effect="none"><div class="nz-separator solid" style="border-bottom-color:#16c3b1;width:100px;border-bottom-width:2px;border-bottom-style:solid;margin-bottom:20px;">&nbsp;</div></div>
Don’t follow trends just because they’re the “hip” thing to do at the moment. Trends represent popular techniques for good reason, but make sure it’s best for your users. For example, an e-commerce site certainly wouldn’t do well as a single-page infinite scrolling site.</p>
<p>Trends are nothing more than additional tools in your designer toolbox. Always pick the right ones for the job.</p>
<p>For more advice on the 10 most important web design trends, check out the free e-book <a href="http://ninzio.com" target="_blank">Web Design Trends 2015 and 2016.</a> You’ll learn from the best with analysis of 166 examples from companies like Google, Apple, Reebok, BMW, Intercom, Adidas, Dropbox, and many more.</p>
